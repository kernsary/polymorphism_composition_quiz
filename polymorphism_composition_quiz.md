# Polymorphism & Composition Homework - Quiz

# Polymorphism

1. What does the ___word___ 'polymorphism' mean?

The state of having 'many shapes'.

2. What does it mean when we apply polymorphism to OO design? Give a simple Java example. An instance of an Aeroplane class and an instance of a Bird class could both also be instances of an IFly interface, as well as also being instances of their respective, separate superclasses.

3. What can we use to implement polymorphism in Java?

Interfaces and superclasses.

4. How many 'forms' can an object take when using polymorphism?

As many as are needed.

5. Give an example of when you could use polymorphism.

If you had two classes which were children of different superclasses, but you also wanted them to share behaviour that the superclasses might not share.


# Composition

6. What do we mean by 'composition' in reference to object-oriented programming?

Composition is when an object 'has' an attribute, as opposed to 'being' something.

7. When would you use composition? Provide a simple example in Java.

If you wanted an object to have an attribute or method it could use. For example, a class could extend an interface so that all its instances could use the methods in that interface.

8. What is/are the advantage(s) of using composition?

It means that objects can use multiple attributes and methods from different sources, rather than just those they inherit from a superclass.

9. When an object is destroyed, what happens to all the objects it is composed of?

Nothing.
